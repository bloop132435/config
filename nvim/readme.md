# Notes
## Clap provider for cht.sh
* curl https://cht.sh/:list shows all categories
	* The result is line separated
* everthing ending with / will be another section, which we can use :list on again
* use --xxx=something to find specifics
## Clap notes
* highlight groups
## Ultisnips notes
* ~~`if &previewwindow` could be used to selectively disable the ultisnips~~ Already used
* `pumvisible()` could be used, works for completion menu but not signature help

# My DotFiles
Repo to put my dotfiles for neovim in\
[Link](https://github.com/bloop132435/dotFiles)
## What I do with Neovim
I use neovim for competitive programming, mainly in c++\
I also use neovim for small python scripts\
In addition, I use nvim to write config files (hence lua and vimscript support)\
I don't, however, do any large scale projects, and therefore this config won't work well for that (probably)
## Goals for this repo
Force me to document my neovim config\
Provide inspiration for other people
